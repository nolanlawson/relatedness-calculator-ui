      Ever wondered how you're related to your

      The relatedness between two people is expressed with two measures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relatedness coefficient:</strong> what percentage of your
        genes you share.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Degree of relation:</strong> how far you are from that person
        in your family tree.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The curious case of <a href="?q=double%20cousins&example=true">double cousins</a>
        occurs when two siblings from one family each marry two siblings
        from another family. Double cousins share 25% of their genes
        &mdash; the same as grandparents/grandchildren and half-siblings.
        No incest involved, but it's still kind of weird!

        10% of marriages worldwide</a> are between cousins. Famous

      </li>
      <li>In terms of relatedness, you are just as likely to "take
        after" your <a href="?q=uncle&example=true">uncle</a> (25%)
        as your <a href="?q=grandfather&example=true">grandfather</a> (25%).
      </li>
      <li>"Once removed," "twice removed," etc. refers to the distance up or down
        your family tree relative to a cousin. For instance, a "second cousin,
        once removed" could be either your
        <a href="?q=second cousin's child&example=true">second cousin's child</a>
        or your <a href="?q=parent's second cousin&example=true">parent's second cousin</a>.
      <li><a href="?q=fraternal twins&example=true">Fraternal twins</a>
        have the same relatedness coefficient as
        regular siblings (50%), but
        <a href="?q=identical twins&example=true">identical twins</a> share 100% of their
        genes. So you're as closely related to your
        <a href="?q=identical twin's children&example=true">identical twin's
          children</a> (50%) as to your own children (50%)!
      </li>
      <li>If there has been incest in your ancestry, you can
        calculate your relatedness coefficient to other family members by
        adding in any extra coefficients due to the incest. For instance,
        if your parents are cousins, then your relatedness to your father
        is 56.25%, because he's your <a
          href="?q=father&example=true">father</a> (50%), as
        well as your <a href="?q=mother's cousin&example=true">mother's cousin</a>
        (6.25%).
      <li>Despite what you may have seen on <a
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama' target="_blank">Futurama</a>, it is
        not possible for <a
          href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry_(Futurama)' target="_blank">Fry</a> to be
        his own grandfather. He would need to share 125% of his genes with
        himself.

    <p>Richard Dawkins gives a great explanation of how to calculate
      relatedness coefficients in <i>The
        Selfish Gene</i>:</p>

    <div id="quoted-text">

      <p>First identify all the common ancestors of A and B. For
        instance, the common ancestors of a pair of first cousins are their
        shared grandfather and grandmother. Once you have found a common
        ancestor, it is of course logically true that all his ancestors are
        common to A and B as well. However, we ignore all but the most
        recent common ancestors. In this sense, first cousins have only two
        common ancestors. If B is a lineal descendant of A, for instance
        his great grandson, then A himself is the ‘common ancestor’ we are
        looking for.</p>
      <p>Having located the common ancestor(s) of A and B, count the
        generation distance as follows. Starting at A, climb up the family
        tree until you hit a common ancestor, and then climb down again to
        B. The total number of steps up the tree and then down again is the
        generation distance. For instance, if A is B’s uncle, the
        generation distance is 3. The common ancestor is A’s father (say)
        and B’s grandfather. Starting at A you have to climb up one
        generation in order to hit the common ancestor. Then to get down to
        B you have to descend two generations on the other side. Therefore
        the generation distance is 1 + 2 = 3.</p>
      <p>Having found the generation distance between A and B via a
        particular common ancestor, calculate that part of their
        relatedness for which that ancestor is responsible. To do this,
        multiply 1/2 by itself once for each step of the generation
        distance. If the generation distance is 3, this means calculate 1/2
        x 1/2 x 1/2 or (1/2)^3. If the generation distance via a particular
        ancestor is equal to g steps, the portion of relatedness due to
        that ancestor is (1/2)^g.</p>
      <p>But this is only part of the relatedness between A and B. If
        they have more than one common ancestor we have to add on the
        equivalent figure for each ancestor. It is usually the case that
        the generation distance is the same for all common ancestors of a
        pair of individuals. Therefore, having worked out the relatedness
        between A and B due to any one of the ancestors, all you have to do
        in practice is to multiply by the number of ancestors. First
        cousins, for instance, have two common ancestors, and the
        generation distance via each one is 4. Therefore their relatedness
        is 2 x (1/2)^4 = 1/8. If A is B’s great-grandchild, the generation
        distance is 3 and the number of common ‘ancestors’ is 1 (B
        himself), so the relatedness is 1 x (1/2)^3 = 1/8.</p>
